PROJECT OVERVIEW

The primary objective of this project is to assess a data set containing diverse
information about residential properties. This data set encompasses a range of crucial
variables, each offering insights into distinct aspects of individual houses. By
scrutinizing these variables, we can obtain valuable knowledge that serves multiple
purposes, such as comprehending real estate market dynamics, making forecasts
regarding housing prices, or aiding decision-making processes for both homeowners
who plan to do renovations and how it may affect the price of the house if they choose
to sell and to buyer who plan to buy houses that have undergone renovations. 

BUSINESS AND DATA UNDERSTANDING

The core of this project lies in gaining a profound understanding of the real estate
market and providing valuable insights to various stakeholders. For this project we
will be mainly focusing on the homeowners who wish to know how renovations will
affect the price of their house(s). DATA
The King County Housing Data Set contains information about the size, location, condition, and other features of houses in Washington's King County. The data-set
and variable descriptions can be found on Kaggle

MODELLING

After exploring and preprocessing the data, simple and multiple linear regression
models were built in OLS statsmodels, with price as the dependent variable. RESULTS
Together, square footage, grade, bedrooms and bathrooms are the best predictors of a
house's price in King County. These features were included in the final multiple
regression model. The model satisfied all multiple regression assumptions, and p- values for each predictor variable were below .05. The r-squared value of the model
was .489.

The four used in the modelling process were chosen due to their strong
correlation with price column. CONCLUSION
The best price predictor o.f house price during renovations with the intent to sell in
King's county is sqft_living and grade.As home owner plan to renovate their house
and add more square footage of space they must also make sure their building grade is
as close to the best as possible to increase the value of one's house. The model has its limitations as the need to log-transform one of the variables to
satisfy the regression assumptions, any new data input needs to undergo the same
preprocessing.Without the use of regional data it must be remebered that house value
may differ according their zipcodes
Future analysis should explore better predictors of the prices of homes outside King
County.
